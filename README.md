# advent-calendar
It's November, so I wanted to make another Christmas themed website. This is an advent calendar. You can press a new button each day to receive something like a Christmas fact, Bible verse, or a small game. And of course there'll be a count down too!


**IMPORTANT**: If it's not December yet, all the days will be locked. To access the days at any time of the year, turn on test mode by tapping or clicking "v" in the "Christmas Advent" heading 5 times. To exit test mode, preform the same action.

Merry Christmas, or if it's not anywhere near Christmas, then hello I guess?
